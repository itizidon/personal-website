        I worked at MUJI as a logistics coordinator for a few months where I
        used Excel to track shipments. I realized I enjoyed the logical thinking
        when working with spreadsheets. During this time I was also taking some
        Udemy courses on Javascript. This is where I realized I wanted to pursue
        a career in development so I interviewed for Fullstack. During my
        experience here, I worked with a team to deploy a e-commerce site and a
        mobile app which keeps inventory of your fridge and recommends you
        recipes based on those items. In a solo project, I cloned the table
        game, blackjack using socket.io, React, and React-Redux to create a
        online multi-player card game.{' '}
